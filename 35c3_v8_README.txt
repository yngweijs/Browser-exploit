I finished the exploit for 35c3 krautflare on windows, and i used the 7.1.0 v8 version. At first I wanted to user rop to complete to exploit, But after reading the Jay Bosamiya's excellent writeup(https://abiondo.me/2019/01/02/exploiting-math-expm1-v8), i know that WASM has a rwx memory,  finally I found the RWX memory with the Cheat engine and complete the exploit.
